# ✅ Verify Storage Bucket Setup

## **Step 1: Check if Bucket Exists** (1 min)

The error means the storage policies already exist, which is good! Let's verify the bucket is properly set up.

### **1.1 Run this verification SQL:**
```sql
-- Check if bucket exists
SELECT 
  id, 
  name, 
  public,
  created_at
FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE id = 'demo-screenshots';

-- If bucket exists, you should see: demo-screenshots | demo-screenshots | true | timestamp
```

### **1.2 If bucket doesn't exist, create it:**
```sql
-- Only create bucket if it doesn't exist
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'demo-screenshots') THEN
    INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
    VALUES ('demo-screenshots', 'demo-screenshots', true);
  END IF;
END $$;

SELECT 'Storage bucket verified!' as status;
```

## **Step 2: Test Your App** (1 min)

1. **Go to:** https://lyzr-concept-tracker.netlify.app
2. **Should now show:** Login form (no storage errors)
3. **If still showing errors:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

## **Step 3: Create Admin Account** (1 min)

1. **Click "Don't have an account? Create one"**
2. **Enter:**
   - Email: `jeremy@lyzr.ai`
   - Password: `admin123456`
   - Display Name: `Jeremy`
3. **Click "Create Account"**

## **✅ Expected Result:**

Since the policies already exist, your storage should be working. The app should now:
- ✅ Show login form
- ✅ Allow admin account creation
- ✅ Have full image upload functionality
- ✅ All tabs should be accessible

**Try the app now - it should work perfectly!**
