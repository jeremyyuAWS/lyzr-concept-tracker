  # Fix RLS Infinite Recursion Error

  This migration resolves the "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'user_profiles'" 
  error by implementing a SECURITY DEFINER function for admin checks.

  ## Problem
  Current RLS policies on user_profiles and demos tables create circular dependencies when 
  checking admin roles, causing infinite recursion.

  ## Solution
  1. Create `is_admin()` SECURITY DEFINER function
     - Bypasses RLS when checking user roles
     - Returns true if current user is admin/super_admin
     - Grants execute permission to authenticated users

  2. Update RLS Policies
     - Drop existing policies that cause recursion
     - Recreate policies using the new is_admin() function
     - Maintain same security model without recursion

  ## Changes
  - New SECURITY DEFINER function: is_admin()
  - Updated user_profiles policies for admin access
  - Updated demos policies for admin access
  - Maintains existing security while fixing recursion
